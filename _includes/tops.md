### Oxford Button Downs
![](/assets/images/ocbd.png)

The oxford button down is a staple of modern male fashion, and a clothing item that every man should take seriously. Oxfords are great for the winter months and are easily paired with chinos, jeans, and jackets. The most important aspect of a button down is the fit of the shirt. When choosing an Oxford, look for a tailored cut and a thick collar.

### Patterned Button Ups

Besides oxfords, one should have a couple other patterned button ups. Casual button ups should not be so busy that they are hard to look at, but instead just subtle enough that they compliment an outfit without taking away from the other parts of it.

### T-Shirts

A T-Shirt is about as basic as you can get. However, don't be fooled - finding the right T-Shirt can be quite tricky. A good T-Shirt is all about fit: too loose and you'll look downright sloppy, but too tight and you'll be showing off your body in ways you probably don't want to.

### Sweaters

Sweaters are a great way to stay warm when it's cold out. Sweaters are unique because they tend to look great with almost any button up shirt you can think of. They are, without a doubt, one of the core building blocks of layering. With sweaters, you'll almost certainly want to stick to cashmere.
