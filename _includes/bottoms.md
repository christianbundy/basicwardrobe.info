### Jeans

A good pair of jeans is the most versatile clothing item in your wardrobe. Jeans are casual, and can be worn consecutively more than any other pant. They are an item that you will almost certainly want to invest in and allow to grow with you. For this reason, I suggest a pair of raw denim.

### Chinos

Chinos (also known as "khakis") are an important part of any wardrobe. Their generally earthy tones lend themselves very well to matching other clothes. Chinos are very easy to dress up or down (moreso than jeans), and pair very well with button downs.

### Shorts

While very seasonal, shorts are essential to any wardrobe that wants to remain relevant in the warmer months of the year. In terms of colors, shorts fall under the same category as chinos. However, it's virtually impossible to dress shorts up. You'll want to look for specific fabrics for shorts - particurally chino, poplin, and linen.
